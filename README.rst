numsys
======
numeral system conversion module; converts values from one number base to another

Any real or complex number can be converted to/from a base of any real or imaginary value

standard
--------
representation in a positional numeral system (base ten, base sixty)

Number bases here are integers (2, 3, 10, ...), negatives, (-2, -10, -25, ...), reals (1.5, 3.14159, -2.71828, ...) or imaginary (2i, -4.5i, 6i, ...). Additionally, inverted values (0.5, -0.36788, 0.001, ...) are allowed in use as a base. Invalid values as a base are 0, 1 and any value whose absolute value is 1.

non-standard
------------
representation in a non-positional numeral system (roman, factorial)

A non-positional numeral system is one where values do not conform to the positional system. These can be alphabetic, like Roman numerals, or a mixed base system, like factorial. Also included are positional-like bases that have limited representation; not all values can be shown. Examples of these are base one and minus one.

digits
------
The first one hundred digits used (in order) are 0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~ \t\n\r\x0b\x0c. After this, which digits are used will be dependent on your system encoding. However, general order will be from the lowest Unicode plane to the highest (skipping already seen digits).
